# Battleships Challenge

## Requeriments

Simple version of the game battleships. It allows a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.

The program creates a 10x10 grid and places a number of ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:
• 1x Battleship (5 squares)
• 2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The player select a cell, to specify a square to target. Shots result in hits, misses, or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.
